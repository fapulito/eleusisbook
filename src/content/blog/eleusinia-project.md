## Website Update

Welcome to the relaunched EleusisBook site, which uses Astro and is deployed using Vercel!

## Eleusis Today

There has been a tremendous proliferation of writing on the topic of psychedelics in the last five years. When I wrote my original paper, it was very difficult to find resources that acknowledged the Mysteries at all. The goal of the paper that I submitted to the conference in Chicago was to make the case for open-sourcing access to certain substances with religious relevance. 

This site will serve as a platform to bring that argument to a wider audience. There are many well-funded corporate organizations today that are presenting visions of contemporary medicine and religion that are anachronistic at best with respect to the evidence of how substances were used traditionally in western culture.

This project encompasses the period of c. 435 BCE to the period of c. 390 CE, with suggestions for other areas of interest that predate this period.
