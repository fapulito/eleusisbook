## Eleusinia

Eleusinia is a cultural project that began with a research paper I originally wrote in 2012 entitled, "The Ecstasy of Graeco-Roman Mystery Religions". It was presented as a poster paper at the 3rd annual Conference on Medicine & Religion at the University of Chicago in 2014. This site will serve as a central resource for my current book project entitled, "Profaning the Mysteries - Βεβηλώνοντας Ελευσίνια".

## Tech Stack

AstroPaper is a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. I am also migrating [my personal blog](https://california.vision/blog) to Astro and plan to stop using Wordpress by April 2024.

This theme is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown is used for blog contents.
